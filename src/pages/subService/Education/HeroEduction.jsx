                    Your priority is to support every child and young person to achieve their potential -
                    which means being able to intervene early to have the greatest chance of success in delivering positive outcomes.
                    But when you’re faced with limited resources, it’s hard to know where, and when, to prioritise support, not to mention the vast range of day-to-day operations required as part of meeting your statutory responsibilities.
                    Our flexible, intuitive software is already helping over 100 UK local authorities to manage their education services more efficiently, offering a uniquely comprehensive and integrated suite of solutions for school admissions,
                    attendance, transport, youth justice, early years and much more. By connecting data securely, you have the whole picture of children and young people for more informed decisions and early intervention, whilst our time-saving
                     solutions free your teams to focus on safeguarding children and delivering targeted support.
